## 2. CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES - Must Fix

### üö® **Typography Implementation Gaps**

**Issue:** Inconsistent use of custom typography classes

**Impact:** Breaks typography hierarchy consistency

### üö® **Spacing System Inconsistencies**

**Issue:** Mixed spacing approaches across components
- **Hero:** Uses `section-spacing` utility class ‚ùå (not implemented)
- **PricingSection:** Uses raw `py-20` instead of systematic spacing
- **StaticGallery:** Uses proper `section-spacing` ‚úÖ
- **ScootProfile:** Uses raw `py-20` instead of systematic spacing

**Impact:** Visual rhythm disruption

### üö® **Color Usage Deviations**

**Issue:** Inconsistent color terminology and usage
- **StaticGallery:** Uses `text-charcoal` and `text-storm-gray` (custom colors) ‚úÖ
- **Other Components:** Use generic `text-black` and `text-gray-700`
