- All component tests failing due to missing expected elements

**Root Cause:** Possible caching issue, incorrect build artifacts, or development server configuration problem.

### 2. Build Quality Issues - HIGH ⚠️

**ESLint Warnings Found:**

  - `components/Testimonials.tsx:190`
- **Character Escaping:** 3 instances of unescaped quotes
  - `components/BookingSection.tsx:66`
  - `components/InstructorProfiles.tsx:90` (2 instances)

### 3. Performance Test Failures - HIGH ⚠️

**Core Web Vitals Issues:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Tests failing due to content mismatch
- Performance thresholds not being met
- Image loading efficiency tests incomplete due to wrong content being served

### 4. Accessibility Compliance Issues - HIGH ⚠️

   - Replace all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components
   - Add proper `alt` attributes to all images
   - Implement lazy loading for performance

3. **Character Escaping - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Fix unescaped quotes in JSX components
   - Use proper HTML entities or escape characters

4. **Accessibility Fixes - HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Address color contrast violations
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Implement proper form labeling

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up continuous Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Implement performance budgets
   - Regular Lighthouse audits

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement visual regression testing
